## What is this?

I'm figuring out how to make supermodern menswear on my blog, [Open Source Garments](https://opensourcegarments.com/). If you're interested, please sign up for the email list!

## How do I use the files?

`.zprj` files can be opened with [CLO 3D](https://clo3d.com/) software. CLO requires a subscription to use.

To learn how to use CLO, YouTube has some tutorials, or you can use [this Udemy series](https://www.udemy.com/course/clo3d-basic-apparel-training-core-module/).
